# Hangman Solitaire

This is the name of the project.

# Description:

Hangman Solitaire is a computer-based version of the classic two-player word game of the same name. The human player competes against the computer to guess a word the program has selected at random.

# Application's major features:

- Obtain a hidden word from a module for generating random words.
- A word is chosen for the player to guess.
- Initially, the player can only see how many letters make up the full word, and the figure of the hanging hook.
- The player begins by guessing letters. Each correct guess reveals every location where the letter exists in word. Each incorrect guess results in revealing the parts of the hangman figure on the hanging hook.
- The player wins if he successfully guesses the word. He loses if he makes six incorrect guesses and if a whole hangman figure is revealed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
